Alhumdulillah for today. Today was a greatly productive day and I feel relieved that I have the code working again. Goal-Frequency feature took a lot of time and was quite stressful to resolve, however, alhumdulillah at the end, Allah blessed me and I have it working. The deployment is working as well, yeay!

Alhumdulillah, I helped phoopa and phoopi with the shop. They need help and alhumdulillah for this opportunity and it was fun as well. I got to sit in a cat after a while and it was fun to shop quickly.

Alhumdulillah, my headache is almost gone and I feel so much relief that Bhai is going and I dont have to go now. InshaAllah, I will be more productive.
