- Alhumdulillah for today. It was good day though I feel, I could have achieved much more. I have the the main code in the team page working, however, the edit page needs a lot of code. Including the refactor of saving functionality and the creating of the structure from text string. Thats a bit of work. InshaAllah will be more productive tomorrow.

- Alhumdulilliah had a great two sessions with Fiza. InshaAllah will get her to be more punctual.

- Alhumdulillah I had an amazing shawarma & its right close to our place too. Alhumdulillah.
