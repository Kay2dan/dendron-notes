# Markup

## Old version: (dated: 2021-01-12)

At the moment, the markup is as follows:

- {g} : set the line as goal title
- {i} : set the line as intro
- {f[0-7]} : set goal frequency
- {d[yyyy/mm/dd]} : set deadline
- In addition to above, we use regular markdown syntax for bold and strikethrough.

## New version: (dated: 2021-01-12)

- #g : at start of line to set the line as goal title
- #i : at start of line to set the line as intro
- #f[0-7] : set goal frequency
- #d[yyyy/mm/dd] : set deadline
- In addition to above, we use regular markdown syntax for bold and strikethrough.
