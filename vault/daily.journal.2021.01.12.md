Alhumdulillah for today. We finally have hot water again after 5 days and its been such a relief. Alhumdulillah. I took a shower!

Alhumdulillah, I fixed the bug that had been bothering me. Alhumdulillah, I told myself to calm down and think about it and it worked and its working now!

Ahlhumdulillah, I learnt a lot more about Dendron and its quite nice. Its a bit of a pain to use as its quite opinionated, however, its quite cool and I can take my notes with me via github.
