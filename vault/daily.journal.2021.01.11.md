Alhumdulillah for yesterday. I had a good coding session. I am disappointed with my actions last night. May Allah forgive me. This is the time for me to review and logically think what I can do to improve and remove attractions and distractions.

First of all, I think as soon as my mind relaxes, I feel like taking risks, which I am not sure, where this is coming from. I need to evaluate my basic thinking, why do I feel dissatisfied with Fiza and what will it take to over come this. I do not believe this is to do with Fiza at all, perhaps my own basic expectations with self.

Alhumdulillah, I have been very blessed all my life. Allah has shielded me from all kinds of problems and issues all my life and I think perhaps one area where I have always and still do feel lacking is accomplishments and maybe this is fueling my desire to achieve something in this life. The dark side from this is that I want all those nice things I always saw successful people have and I, as a person lack. Those beautiful women etc and as I cannot have them so I desire such even more. May Allah guide me.

Clearly, first thing first is to seek Allah's help, I have to go back to Allah and recite The Quran more and more. I think I need to maybe set the time in the evening before bed to recite the Quran, even if I dont have wudu so that its fresh in my mind inshaAllah.

May Allah guide me.
