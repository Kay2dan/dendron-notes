Hold a session with Fiza, where we both write our values.
We define what we aspire to.
We define what our expections are from ourselves.
We define what our expectations are from each other.
We define what we want from each other.

And then later, we should write a response to each other's values, after a cooling period of 1 week in which we think about these.
